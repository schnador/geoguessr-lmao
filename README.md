## Permissions & Security

- **@grant GM_xmlhttpRequest** â€” For Learnable Meta API integration
- **@grant GM_addStyle** â€” For CSS injection
- **@grant unsafeWindow** â€” For localStorage access
- **@connect learnablemeta.com** â€” To fetch Learnable Meta map info

No data is sent anywhere except to the [Learnable Meta](https://learnablemeta.com/) API for map detection.

All tags and settings are fetched from their API and stored locally in your browser.

---

## Learnable Meta API usage

The Learnable Meta integration works by checking maps which don't have a localStorage entry via the Learnable Meta API, just as the Learnable Meta userscript would.
This information is stored locally, and never refetched unless you clean your localStorage to keep the API calls to a minimum.

I will do the best to react quickly to any changes in the Learnable Meta userscript to keep the integration seamless.
